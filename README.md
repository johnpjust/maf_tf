# Masked Autoregressive Flow - Tensorflow

This repository's aim is to adapt G. Papamakarios' [maf](https://github.com/gpapamak/maf/) classes to from Theano to Tensorflow in order to use them in a future.

The classes to be adapted are:
* __MADE__: Masked Autoregressive for Distribution Estimation.
* __MAF__: Masked Autoregressive Flow.

Aside from this, also training functions and their conditional counterparts will be implemented.
